  # General Notes
  
  ## Styling
  
  Most of the pages take from the css file 'index.css'. This was to keep the styling consistent among the buttons and header throughout the pages. 
  
  ## Firebase
  
  ### Storage
  This project was setup with a Firebase database as well as a Firebase storage bucket. The database currently stores all of the project information and the storage bucket stores all of the extra files such as images, documents, etc. In each instance, the project are stored under their unique project ID as inputed by the user. 
   
  ### Editing
  In order to allow editing, the user is allowed to edit a projects page. If the user changes anything except the project ID, the project's information is written over. If the user changes the project ID, an entire new project is created and the information written on that new project. The old project is then deleted to avoid duplicates.
    
   ### Routing 
   The application is currently passing the project ID from whatever LI the user clicks on from the main screen through the project URL. This ID then is used to find the correct project in Firebase.
   
   ## Data
    The current data structure represents the 3 departments at Thompson Thrift. Which are: Watermark, Retail, and Construction. Some of these departments contain more categories based on the actions they do with their properties. For example, Watermark and Retail contains sub-categores. These are Acquisition, Development-Design, Construction-Preconstruction, and Disposition. In these sub-categories there should be attributes that would give users the ability to filter through projects based on their division and its sub-categories.
